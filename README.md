# llm_portfolio_recommendation
 A Streamlit app using Langchain and OpenAI API to generate a financial portfolio recommendation based on a country and bond types

We'll structure the project into three main files:

streamlit_app.py: The main Streamlit app file that interacts with the user and presents the output.

langchain_code.py: This Python script will implement Langchain logic using OpenAI to get bond recommendations.

config.py: This file stores the OpenAI API key for authentication.
